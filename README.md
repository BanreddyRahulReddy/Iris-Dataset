# Iris-Dataset
The Iris dataset contains data on 150 iris flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. For each flower, four features are recorded: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Itâ€™s widely used in machine learning to practice classification algorithms.
The Iris dataset is often used as a beginner-friendly dataset in machine learning. It contains 150 rows of data, with each row representing a different flower. The dataset is split into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with 50 flowers from each species.

The four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are the attributes that describe the flowers. These measurements help in identifying the species of the flower. In machine learning, this dataset is used to teach classification algorithms, which are techniques that can help predict the species of a flower based on its measurements.

The dataset is useful for practicing how to train a model, test it, and make predictions. It also helps in learning how to visualize data and evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
