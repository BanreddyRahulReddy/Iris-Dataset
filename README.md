# Iris-Dataset
The Iris dataset contains data on 150 iris flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. For each flower, four features are recorded: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Itâ€™s widely used in machine learning to practice classification algorithms.
